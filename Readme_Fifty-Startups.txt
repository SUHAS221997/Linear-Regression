This repository contains an implementation of Linear Regression to predict the Profit of startups based on various features such as R&D Spend, Administration Spend, Marketing Spend, and State. The dataset, known as the Fifty Startups Dataset, is often used in machine learning and statistics for demonstrating regression models.
Dataset
The Fifty Startups Dataset includes data for 50 startups in different states of the USA, with the following columns:
•	R&D Spend: Amount of money spent on research and development.
•	Administration Spend: Amount spent on administration.
•	Marketing Spend: Amount spent on marketing.
•	State: State in which the startup operates (categorical variable).
•	Profit: Profit generated by the startup (dependent variable).
Objective
The main objective is to build a linear regression model to predict the Profit based on the other features. This project demonstrates:
•	Data preprocessing (including encoding categorical variables).
•	Building and training a linear regression model.
•	Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
•	Visualizing the results and interpreting the model.
Features
•	Data Preprocessing: Encoding categorical variables (State), scaling numeric values.
•	Model Implementation: Implementing linear regression using both Normal Equation and Gradient Descent.
•	Model Evaluation: Using evaluation metrics such as R² and MSE.
•	Visualization: Plotting results and visualizing the relationship between features and profit.
Requirements
Before running the code, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
•	numpy
•	pandas
•	matplotlib
•	seaborn
•	sklearn
